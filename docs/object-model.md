# The MEOS object model

`meta/object-model.json` is the **single codegen source of truth** for the
class hierarchy implicit in MEOS. The pipeline folds it into
`meos-idl.json` as `objectModel`. Every binding/engine (PyMEOS, JMEOS,
MEOS.NET, MobilityDuck, MobilitySpark, …) derives the **identical**
classes and methods from this one mapping, so the OO surface is no longer
re-curated by hand in each repo.

## Why

MEOS is C: it has no classes. The object model is encoded by *convention*
in three places:

1. **The template axis** — the `Temporal` / `TInstant` / `TSequence` /
   `TSequenceSet` struct family, discriminated by the `subtype` field.
2. **The type-family axis** — the `temptype` discriminator. Its *base
   type* (e.g. `T_TFLOAT` → `T_FLOAT8`) is the missing template
   parameter; this is the inheritance lattice.
3. **The method binding** — a function's name prefix says which class it
   is a method of: `temporal_*` is the late-bound **superclass** (every
   temporal type), `tnumber_*`/`tspatial_*`/`tpoint_*`/`tgeo_*` are the
   abstract families, `tbool_*`/`tint_*`/`tfloat_*`/… are the exact leaf
   types, `tinstant_*`/`tsequence_*`/`tsequenceset_*` are the template
   subtypes.

The most mature hand-built model (PyMEOS) is used as a parity **oracle**,
not the source of truth — it is a strict subset of today's MEOS.

## The lattice

Single-inheritance tree. The base type is the missing template parameter;
the geometry/geodetic distinction is a **trait** axis, not a parent (so
there is no diamond):

The spatial subtree follows the authoritative MobilityDB manual
(Ch. 7 Figure 7.1): `TGeo` is the broad parent of every PostGIS-derived
type; `TPoint` is an API-level intermediate under `TGeo` (see
[Manual reconciliation](#manual-reconciliation)).

```

   ├─ TPose                                        base POSE     (#if POSE)
   └─ TRGeometry                                   base POSE     (#if RGEO)
```

A **concrete class** is the product *leaf × subtype* — `TFloatSeq`,
`TGeomPointInst`, `TRGeometrySeqSet`. Methods of a node are inherited by
all descendants; `objectModel.lattice` carries the derived
`children`/`ancestors`/`depth` so consumers can expand the effective
method set per concrete class.

`cbuffer`, `npoint`, `pose`, `rgeo` are **full leaf classes and in
scope** — never deferred. `trgeometry` is the user-facing name; internal
functions keep the `trgeo_` prefix and are **not** normalized.

## Manual reconciliation

The MobilityDB manual (Ch. 7, *Temporal Geometry Types*, Figure 7.1
"Hierarchy of spatiotemporal types", source `doc/images/tspatial.svg`) is
the **authoritative conceptual model** for the spatial subtree. The model
reconciles to it exactly, with one documented difference:

- The figure is **partial** — spatial-only; it omits the `Temporal` root
  and the whole `TAlpha`/`TNumber` subtree (`OM-M6`). This model is the
  complete superset.
- The figure makes **`TGeo` the broad parent** of `TGeometry`,
  `TGeography`, `TGeomPoint`, `TGeogPoint` ("TGeo and its subtypes …
  derived from the PostGIS types geometry and geography"). The model uses
  the broad C predicate `tgeo_type_all` for `TGeo` class membership;
  the narrow `tgeo_type()` (and the point-rejecting `tgeo_*` functions)
  is the real irregularity, sharpened in `OM-M1`.
- The figure draws no `TPoint` node, but the C API has `tpoint_type()`
  and a 25-function `tpoint_*` family that must bind to a class. The
  model inserts **`TPoint` as an API-level abstract under `TGeo`** — the
  single, documented addition (`OM-M6`).
- `tpcpoint`/`tpcpatch` (temporal point-cloud point/patch) are absent
  from both master MEOS and Figure 7.1 (`OM-M7`); they are out of the
  drift-gated source of truth and derived automatically once MEOS
  defines them — never fabricated.
- Class names use the manual spelling (`TGeo`, `TNpoint`, `TCbuffer`,
  `TPose`, `TRGeometry`); C prefixes (`tnpoint_`, `tcbuffer_`,
  `trgeo_`) are unchanged.

`tests/test_object_model.py::ModelFileTests::test_matches_manual_figure_7_1`
gates this: the model's spatial node set must equal the figure's nodes
plus `TPoint`, with the figure's parent edges intact — so the
reconciliation cannot silently regress.

## Closed algebra: companion hierarchies

MEOS is a closed algebra: temporal operations return and consume spans,
sets and boxes (`tnumber_to_span` → a `Span`, `temporal_time` → a
`TstzSpanSet`, `tnumber_to_tbox` → `TBox`). The methods cannot be typed
without these, so `objectModel.companions` carries two parallel
hierarchies — `Box` (`TBox`, `STBox`) and `Collection`
(`Set`/`Span`/`SpanSet` with the concrete int/bigint/float/text/date/
tstz/geo/… leaves) — and `objectModel.algebra` records which companion a
temporal family yields.

## Method assignment

`objectModel.functionToClass` maps every catalog function to the class it
is a method of, by **longest-prefix match** (so `tgeompoint_*` beats
`tgeo_*`, `tsequenceset_*` beats `tsequence_*`, and `tfloatinst_*`
resolves to the concrete `TFloatInst`). The assignment **reuses the
function itself** as the backing symbol — equivalence by construction, no
C-symbol guessing. A function with no prefix match (operator overloads,
`datum_*`/`geo_*` base helpers, plumbing) is recorded honestly with
`class: null` and a reason — never force-fitted.

## Dispatch metadata

For 4 of the 6 temporal-type families the per-member argument→backing
routing is mechanically derivable from the `<member>_<type>_<arg>` C-name
token model, so faithful codegen needs nothing more than
`functionToClass`. The **`geo`** (`TGeomPoint`/`TGeogPoint`) and
**`temporal`** (`TFloat`/`TInt`/`TBool`/`TText`) families encode *editorial*
dispatch decisions that are absent from the C signatures (e.g. a Python
`Point` vs `BaseGeometry` split routing to *different* backings; scalar
arguments passed **by value** with a per-member cast; `IntSet`→`FloatSet`
coercion via the superclass). `objectModel.dispatch` makes that routing a
**catalog fact**, transcribed verbatim from the PyMEOS cross-repo handoff
RFC #94 §3 (the source of truth — extracted from PyMEOS's working
hand-written oracle; never re-derived), so every binding's faithful
generator emits geo/temporal with equivalence by construction instead of
per-binding editorial guesses.

`dispatch.geo` is **single-block** (`dispatch.geo.<member>`; `TGeomPoint`
vs `TGeogPoint` is disambiguated at runtime by `geodeticFromSelf`).
`dispatch.temporal` is **per concrete type** —
`dispatch.temporal.{tfloat,tint,tbool,ttext}.<member>` — fully resolved
(no `<t>`/`<base>` placeholders), because the editorial routing differs
per type (e.g. `tint` coerces Float→Int, the opposite of `tfloat`;
`tint.temporal_equal` takes the value uncast while `tfloat` casts;
`tbool` exposes only `temporal_equal/not_equal`/`at`/`minus`).

Each member has an ordered `dispatch` table (`py` type token → `fn`
backing; optional `argTransform`/`extraArgs`/`coerce`+`via`/
`geodeticFromSelf`; a `py:"scalar"` entry carries `scalarType`, the exact
`isinstance` test, e.g. `"float"`, `"int|float"`, `"bool"`, `"str"`),
plus `fallback` and `result`. The `py` token may be `"scalar"`,
`"self"`, a class name, or `"list[str]"`
(`isinstance(o, list) and isinstance(o[0], str)`). The tables are
transcribed verbatim from the hand-written oracle (RFC #94 §3 + the
complete extended §7) — never derived.

### argTransform vocabulary

`argTransform` is a **closed, named** vocabulary — each binding maps every
name to its own idiom; the set is finite because the editorial decisions
are finite:

| Name | Meaning (PyMEOS idiom shown) |
|---|---|
| `geoToGserialized` | shapely geometry → GSERIALIZED (`geo_to_gserialized($o, <geodetic>)`) |
| `stboxToGeo` | STBox → geometry (`stbox_to_geo($o._inner)`) |
| `scalarCast` | scalar cast to the block's concrete base (`float($o)` for `tfloat`, `int($o)` for `tint`) |
| `scalarValue` | scalar passed by value as-is (`$o`) |
| `textsetMake` | `list[str]` → text set (`textset_make($o)`) |
| `innerPtr` | pass the wrapped C pointer (`$o._inner`) |
| `geodeticFromSelf` | the only runtime-self primitive (PyMEOS → `isinstance(self, TGeogPoint)`) |
| `coerce`+`via:super` | Python-side type coercion then delegate to the superclass method |

## The error contract

MEOS has a single raise mechanism:
`meos_error(int errlevel, int errcode, const char *fmt, ...)`, where
`errcode` is an `errorCode` enum value. `objectModel.errors.codes` carries
the full taxonomy (verbatim, drift-gated against `meos.h`).
`objectModel.errors.raises` is derived by a static scan of the MobilityDB
C sources: the literal `meos_error` codes in each function body, plus one
indirection level through the `ensure_*` argument guards (tagged
`via: "direct" | "ensure"`). If the sources are unavailable the scan is a
no-op and `errors.status = "source-unavailable"` — an honest signal,
never a fabricated empty set.

## Parity audit

`object_model_parity.py` is the object-model analogue of
`portable_parity.py`. It parses the PyMEOS factory (the oracle, never
hard-coded) and writes `output/meos-object-model-parity.json`: every
structural divergence (classes/abstracts/collections MEOS defines that
PyMEOS lacks) as a worklist entry. A divergence already explained by a
curated `corrections` item is `known`; an unexplained one is
`needs-correction`. `tests/test_object_model_parity.py` gates
**0 `needs-correction`** (every divergence has a stated correction) and
that nothing is silently dropped — the analogue of the portable
0-unbacked gate. If the oracle is absent the audit degrades to
`oracle-unavailable` (curated corrections still carried, no fabricated
verdict).

## Irregularities (corrections worklist)

Making the implicit model explicit surfaces irregularities in *both*
MEOS and PyMEOS (a decade of manual evolution). They are carried verbatim
in `objectModel.corrections` as a durable, reviewable worklist
(`OM-M*` = MEOS-side, `OM-P*` = PyMEOS-side), e.g.:

- **OM-M1** the class `TGeo` is broad (manual = `tgeo_type_all`) but the
  narrow C `tgeo_type()` and most `tgeo_*` functions reject points —
  API applicability is narrower than class membership.
- **OM-M2** `tgeometry_type()` means *geometry-based (non-geodetic)*, not
  *is the TGeometry type* — a misnomer paired with `tgeodetic_type()`.
- **OM-M3** `TRGeometry`'s base type is `T_POSE` (base ≠ name).
- **OM-M4** `talpha_type` is a real grouping with no user-facing class.
- **OM-M6** the manual Figure 7.1 is partial (spatial-only) and draws no
  `TPoint`; the model is the superset and adds `TPoint` under `TGeo`.
- **OM-M7** `tpcpoint`/`tpcpatch` are planned but absent from master
  MEOS and the figure — out of the drift-gated SoT until MEOS adds them.
- **OM-P1/P6/P7** PyMEOS lacks the `TGeometry/TGeography/TCbuffer/
  TNpoint/TPose/TRGeometry` leaves, the full Collection hierarchy, and
  the `TSpatial`/`TGeo` abstract intermediates that MEOS defines.

Reporting only — the fixes land as separate PRs in those repos by their
own sessions.

## Drift gate

The curated lattice cannot silently drift from MEOS:
`tests/test_object_model.py::DriftGate` re-derives every membership set
from the MobilityDB sources (the predicate bodies, `MEOS_TEMPTYPE_CATALOG`,
the `tempSubtype` and `errorCode` enums) and asserts the curated meta
matches. (Public model excludes the internal `T_TDOUBLE{2,3,4}`
aggregation types.) Run `python setup.py` to fetch the sources, then
`python3 tests/test_object_model.py`.

## Provenance
